# Accessibility

Making your platform accessible by anyone no matter their condition.

## What does accessibility mean for mobile?

We need to make this native world a more inclusive place for everyone and designing a seamless user experience for everyone.

## The Curb Cut Effect

The curb cut effect means that the solution built serves a wide array of individuals no matter their situation.

Accessibility is always an after thought when it shouldn't be

## How to add accessibility to our app

- Be mindful of colours. 

Resources:
colorable

- Convert designer's pallettes into common components, which helps adding accessibility more seamless

- Use `Storybook` to communicate

- Keeping animations minimal, give users options to turn animations off

- font scaling

## React Native Accessibility 

- `accessibilityLabel Overrides the text that's read by the screen reader

- `accessibility={true}` It will read everything inside it as once but not touchables please

These are just a few of many APIs available for the text component

Use a linter
