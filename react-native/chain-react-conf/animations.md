# Animations in React Native

## Cognitive load

the total amount of mental effort that is required to complete a thought

## Cognitive friction 

Cognitive friction occurs when a user is confronted with a interface that is not predictable.

UI should be predictable and should react fluidly with user interactions 

## Micro Interactions vs Actions driven animations

Micro interactions are more subtle and easy on the eyes while animations based on action driven can cause cognitive fiction and should be approached with caution.

## Divide and conquer

- Micro interactions
- Action driven animations
- Screen transition 
- Gesture animations / onScroll behaviors eg. react-navigation-fliud
