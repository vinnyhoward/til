# Textures

## Texture types

## Color (or Albedo)

It is the most simple one applied to geometry 

## Alpha
- Gray scale image

- White visible

- black not visible

## Height (or displacement)

- gray scale image

- Move the vertices to create some relief 

- Need enough sub division

## Normal
- Add details

- Doesn't need sub division

- The vertices don't move 

- Lure the light about the face orientation

- Better performances than adding a height texture with a lot of sub divisions

## Ambient Occlusion

- Gray scale image

- Add fake shadows in crevices

- Not physically accurate 

- Helps to create contrast and see details

## Metalness

- Gray scale iamge

- White is metallic

- Black is non-metallic

- Mostly for reflection

## Roughness

- Gray scale image

- In duo with the metalness

- White is rough

- Black is smooth

- Mostly for light dissipation

These commonly used textures (there are more types but these are the most used) follow the PBR principles

- Physically based rendering

- Many technics that tend to follow real-life directions to get realistic results

- Becoming the standard for realistic renders

- Many software, engines, and libraries are using it
