# Symmetrical Encryption

This is the simplest version of encryption that only needs one secret key to cipher and decipher. 
```Symmetrical Encryption``` is an old and best-known technique. The secret key can be anything, from numbers to letters. An example of a technology using ```Symmetrical Encryption``` is ```SSH```

Main disadvantages of the symmetric encryption system is that all parties involved have to exchange the key used to encrypt the data before they can decrypt the data. Or if an unwanted third party finds the key (which is highly unlikely), your information will be breached.

# Asymmetrical Encryption

```Asymmetrical encryption``` is also known as ```public key``` cryptography, which is a relatively new method, compared to ```symmetric encryption```. ```Asymmetric encryption``` uses two keys to encrypt a plain text. ```Secret keys``` are exchanged over the Internet or a large network. 

It ensures that malicious persons do not misuse the keys. It is important to note that anyone with a ```secret key``` can decrypt the message and this is why ```asymmetrical encryption``` uses two related keys to boosting security. A ```public key``` is made freely available to anyone who might want to send you a message. The second ```private key``` is kept a secret so that you can only know.
