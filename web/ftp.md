# FTP (File Transfer Protocol)

The ```File Transfer Program``` (FTP) is a standard network protocol used for the transfer of computer files between a client and server on a computer network.

```FTP``` is built on a client-server model architecture separate control and data connections between the client and the server.[1] ```FTP``` users may authenticate themselves with a clear-text sign-in protocol, normally in the form of a username and password, but can connect anonymously if the server is configured to allow it. For secure transmission that protects the username and password, and encrypts the content, FTP is often secured with SSL/TLS (FTPS) or replaced with SSH File Transfer Protocol (SFTP).
