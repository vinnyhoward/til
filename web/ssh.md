# Secure Shell

```Secure Shell``` (SSH) is a cryptographic network protocol for operating network services securely over an unsecured network.[1] The standard ```TCP``` port for ```SSH``` is 22. The best known example application is for remote login to computer systems by users.

```SSH``` uses public-key cryptography to authenticate the remote computer and allow it to authenticate the user, if necessary. There are several ways to use SSH; one is to use automatically generated public-private key pairs to simply encrypt a network connection, and then use password authentication to log on.

SSH provides a secure channel over an unsecured network in a client-server architecture, connecting an SSH client application with an SSH server. Common applications include remote command-line login and remote command execution, but any network service can be secured with SSH. The protocol specification distinguishes between two major versions, referred to as SSH-1 and SSH-2.
