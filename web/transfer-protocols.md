# HTTP - HyperText Transfer Protocol

```HTTP``` means ```HyperText Transfer Protocol```. ```HTTP``` is the underlying protocol used by the World Wide Web and this protocol defines how messages are formatted and transmitted, and what actions Web servers and browsers should take in response to various commands.

```HTTP``` is called a stateless protocol because each command is executed independently, without any knowledge of the commands that came before it. This is the main reason that it is difficult to implement Web sites that react intelligently to user input. This shortcoming of HTTP is being addressed in a number of new technologies, including ```ActiveX```, ```Java```,``` JavaScript``` and ```cookies```.

## HTTPS 

_HTTP VS HTTPS_

```Hyper Text Transfer Protocol Secure``` (HTTPS) is the secure version of ```HTTP```, the protocol over which data is sent between your browser and the website that you are connected to. The 'S' at the end of ```HTTPS``` stands for 'Secure'. It means all communications between your browser and the website are encrypted. ```HTTPS``` is often used to protect highly confidential online transactions like online banking and online shopping order forms.

Web browsers such as Internet Explorer, Firefox and Chrome also display a padlock icon in the address bar to visually indicate that a HTTPS connection is in effect.
