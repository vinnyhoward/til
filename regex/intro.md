# Introduction to Regex

Regular expressions (regex or regexp) are extremely useful in extracting information from any text by searching for one or more matches of a specific search pattern (i.e. a specific sequence of ```ASCII``` or ```unicode``` characters).

Fields of application range from ```validation``` to ```parsing```/```replacing strings```, passing through translating data to other formats and ```web scraping```.

One of the most interesting features is that once you’ve learned the syntax, you can actually use this tool in (almost) all programming languages ​​(JavaScript, Java, VB, C #, C / C++, Python, Perl, Ruby, Delphi, R, Tcl, and many others) with the slightest distinctions about the support of the most advanced features and syntax versions supported by the engines).
