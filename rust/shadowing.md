# Shadowing

You can declare a new variable with the same name as a previous variable, and the new variable shadows the previous variable. People say that the first variable is shadowed by the second, which means that the second variable’s value is what appears when the variable is used. We can shadow a variable by using the same variable’s name and repeating the use of the let keyword as follows:

```rust
fn main() {
    let x = 5;

    let x = x + 1;

    let x = x * 2;

    println!("The value of x is: {}", x);
}
```

This program first binds `x` to a value of `5`. Then it shadows `x` by repeating `let x =`, taking the original value and adding `1` so the value of `x` is then `6`. The third let statement also shadows `x`, multiplying the previous value by `2 `to give `x` a final value of `12`. When we run this program, it will output the following:

```
$ cargo run
   Compiling variables v0.1.0 (file:///projects/variables)
    Finished dev [unoptimized + debuginfo] target(s) in 0.31s
     Running `target/debug/variables`
The value of x is: 12
```

Shadowing is different from marking a variable as `mut`, because we’ll get a compile-time error if we accidentally try to reassign to this variable without using the let keyword. By using let, we can perform a few transformations on a value but have the variable be immutable after those transformations have been completed.

The other difference between `mut` and shadowing is that because we’re effectively creating a new variable when we use the let keyword again, we can change the type of the value but reuse the same name. For example, say our program asks a user to show how many spaces they want between some text by inputting space characters, but we really want to store that input as a number:

```rust
    let spaces = "   ";
    let spaces = spaces.len();
```

This construct is allowed because the first spaces variable is a string type and the second spaces variable, which is a brand-new variable that happens to have the same name as the first one, is a number type. Shadowing thus spares us from having to come up with different names, such as spaces_str and spaces_num; instead, we can reuse the simpler spaces name. However, if we try to use mut for this, as shown here, we’ll get a compile-time error:

```
$ cargo run
   Compiling variables v0.1.0 (file:///projects/variables)
error[E0308]: mismatched types
 --> src/main.rs:3:14
  |
3 |     spaces = spaces.len();
  |              ^^^^^^^^^^^^ expected `&str`, found `usize`

error: aborting due to previous error

Now that we’ve explored how variables work, let’s look at more data types they can have.
