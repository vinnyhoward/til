# Packages and Crates

 A crate is a binary or library. The crate root is a source file that the Rust compiler starts from and makes up the root module of your crate. A package is one or more crates that provide a set of functionality. A package contains a Cargo.toml file that describes how to build those crates. Several rules determine what a package can contain. A package can contain at most one library crate. It can contain as many binary crates as youâ€™d like, but it must contain at least one crate (either library or binary).

A crate is a compilation unit in Rust. Whenever `rustc some_file.rs` is called, `some_file.rs` is treated as the crate file. If `some_file.rs` has mod declarations in it, then the contents of the module files would be inserted in places where mod declarations in the crate file are found, before running the compiler over it. In other words, modules do not get compiled individually, only crates get compiled.

A crate can be compiled into a binary or into a library. By default, `rustc` will produce a binary from a crate. This behavior can be overridden by passing the `--crate-type` flag to `lib`.
