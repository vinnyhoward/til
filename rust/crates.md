# Packages and Crates

 A crate is a binary or library. The crate root is a source file that the Rust compiler starts from and makes up the root module of your crate. A package is one or more crates that provide a set of functionality. A package contains a Cargo.toml file that describes how to build those crates. Several rules determine what a package can contain. A package can contain at most one library crate. It can contain as many binary crates as youâ€™d like, but it must contain at least one crate (either library or binary).
