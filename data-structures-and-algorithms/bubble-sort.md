# Bubble Sort
```Bubble Sort``` or also called ```sinking sort``` is the simplest sorting algorithm that works by repeatedly swapping the adjacent elements if they are in wrong order. The time complexity with this algorithm is log(n<sup>2</sup>) for worse and average cases. But for best cases the time complexity is actually log(n)
