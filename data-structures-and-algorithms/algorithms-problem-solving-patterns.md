# Algorithms and Problem Solving Patterns

## Problem Solving Strategies

Understand the problem before you try to solve it. Explore concrete examples and research its topics/theories/concepts to give a more in depth look into the problem. After understanding and researching the problem, break it down into smaller parts, solve and then look back and try to refactor where you can to make it more readable and or efficient.

## Steps to help understand a problem

1. Can I restate the problem in my own words?

2. What are the inputs that go into the problem?

3. What are the outputs that should come from the solution to the problem?

4. Can the outputs be determined from the inputs? In other words, do I have enough information to solve the problem? (You may not be able to answer this question until you set about solving the problem. Thats okay; it's still worth considering the question at this early stage.)

5. How should I label the important pieces of data that are a part of the problem?

## Explore Concrete Examples

Coming up with examples can help you understand the problem better. Examples also provide sanity checks that your eventual solutions works how it should. 

- Start with simple examples (write it down, what are the inputs? What about the outputs?)

- Progress to more complex examples

- Explore examples with empty inputs

- Explore examples with invalid inputs

## Break down the problem

Write out the step that you will take to solve the problem, it can be pseudo code, it can be just guidelines written with comments, or whatever helps you best to visualize and breaking it down to smaller digestible parts. This forces you to think about the code you'll write before you write it, and helps you catch any lingering conceptual issues or misunderstandings before you dive in and have to worry about the details.
