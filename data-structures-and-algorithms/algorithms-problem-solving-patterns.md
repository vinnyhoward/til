# Algorithms and Problem Solving Patterns

## Problem Solving Strategies

Understand the problem before you try to solve it. Explore concrete examples and research its topics/theories/concepts to give a more in depth look into the problem. After understanding and researching the problem, break it down into smaller parts, solve and then look back and try to refactor where you can to make it more readable and or efficient.

## Steps to help understand a problem

1. Can I restate the problem in my own words?

2. What are the inputs that go into the problem?

3. What are the outputs that should come from the solution to the problem?

4. Can the outputs be determined from the inputs? In other words, do I have enough information to solve the problem? (You may not be able to answer this question until you set about solving the problem. Thats okay; it's still worth considering the question at this early stage.)

5. How should I label the important pieces of data that are a part of the problem?
