# Trees

```Trees``` are really similar too ```Linked Lists```, the difference is that ```Linked Lists``` have one ```Next``` element, while ```trees``` have several. Just like a ```Linked List``` each element on a ```tree``` has some type of data which is stored in what is called a ```node```. The base of the ```tree``` is called the ```root```, the fringes or the ends of each element that are no longer connected to another ```node``` are called ```leaves``` or external ```nodes```. ```Nodes``` in a ```tree``` are often called having a ```parent-child``` relationships. With the ```root``` being the ```parent```, while the nodes below it are the ```child```. Nodes can be both a ```parent``` and a ```child``` if they have ```nodes``` connecting to it. The ```height``` of the ```nodes``` are determined by the amount of ```levels``` there are in the ```tree```. 

## Requirements of a Tree data structure

- A ```tree``` must completely connected. There must be some way to be able to locate another ```node```

- There cannot be any ```cycles``` in the ```tree```. A cycle is where there is way to encounter the same ```node``` twice.
