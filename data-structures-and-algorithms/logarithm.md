# Logarithm

In its simplest form, a logarithm answers the question:

How many of one number do we multiply to get another number?

The logarithm is the `inverse` function to `exponentiation` (it is an example of a concave function). That means the logarithm of a given number `x` is the exponent to which another fixed number, the base `b`, must be raised, to produce that number `x`. In the simplest case, the logarithm counts repeated multiplication of the same factor; e.g., since `1000 = 10 × 10 × 10 = 103`, the "logarithm to base 10" of `1000` is `3`.

Rule of thumb:

The logarithm of a number roughly measures the number of times you can divide that number by 2 before you can get a value that's less than or equal to one.

## Why logarithms matter

- Certain searching algorithms have logarithmic time complexity. 

- Efficient sorting algorithms involve logarithms

- Recursion sometimes involves logarithmic space complexity

## Most common logarithms

1. Common Logarithms: ```Base 10```
Sometimes a logarithm is written without a base, like this ```log(100)```

This usually means that the base is really 10.

Example:

```
 log(1000) = log10(1000) = 3
 ```

2. Natural Logarithms: ```Base "e"```
Another base that is often used is e (Euler's Number) which is about 2.71828.

Example: 

```
ln(7.389) = loge(7.389) ≈ 2
```
