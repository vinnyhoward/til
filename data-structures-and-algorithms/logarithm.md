# Logarithm

In its simplest form, a logarithm answers the question:

How many of one number do we multiply to get another number?

The logarithm is the `inverse` function to `exponentiation` (it is an example of a concave function). That means the logarithm of a given number `x` is the exponent to which another fixed number, the base `b`, must be raised, to produce that number `x`. In the simplest case, the logarithm counts repeated multiplication of the same factor; e.g., since `1000 = 10 × 10 × 10 = 103`, the "logarithm to base 10" of `1000` is `3`.

Rule of thumb:

The logarithm of a number roughly measures the number of times you can divide that number by 2 before you can get a value that's less than or equal to one.

## Why logarithms matter

- Certain searching algorithms have logarithmic time complexity. 

- Efficient sorting algorithms involve logarithms

- Recursion sometimes involves logarithmic space complexity
