# Binary Tree

```Binary Tree``` is a tree data structure that will only have at the very most, two ```children```. Which are commonly called ```left child``` and ```right child```. ```Parent``` nodes can have zero, one and a max of two ```children```. 

## Types of binary tree

- A ```Rooted``` binary tree has a root node and every node has at most two children.
- A ```Full``` binary tree (also called a proper or plane binary tree) is a tree in which every node has either 0 or 2 children.

- A ```Perfect``` binary tree is a binary tree in which all interior nodes have two children and all leaves have the same depth or same level. (Also called a complete binary tree) 

An example of a ```perfect``` binary tree is the ancestry chart of a person to a given depth, as each person has exactly two biological parents

-  ```Infinite``` complete binary tree, every node has two children (and so the set of levels is countably infinite). The set of all nodes is countably infinite

- A ```Balanced``` binary tree has the minimum possible maximum height (depth) for the leaf nodes because, for any given number of leaf nodes, the leaf nodes are placed at the greatest height possible
