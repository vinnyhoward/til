# Express

## These are topics that are touched upon in the UtahNodeJS meet up
Some topics will be revisited and reviewed in my TIL repo so you may see some of the same information provided

Express is the most popular ```Node``` web framework and is the most used framework for RESTful APIs.

- Write handlers for requests with different HTTP verbs at different URL paths (routes).

- Integrate with "view" rendering engines in order to generate responses by inserting data into templates.

- Set common web application settings like the port to use for connecting, and the location of templates that are used for rendering the response.

- Add additional request processing "middleware" at any point within the request handling pipeline.

While ```Express``` itself is fairly minimalistic, the community has created a plethora of compatible middleware packages that compliment and address almost any web development problem that is out there. There are libraries out there that can help with topics such as ```cookies```, ```sessions```, ```authentication```, ```URL parameters```, ```POST data```, ```security headers```, and that is just the tip of the ice berg. You can find a list of middleware packages maintained by the express team on their website.
