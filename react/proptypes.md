# PropTypes

As your app scales, you can catch a lot of bugs with type checking. For some applications, you can use JavaScript extensions like Flow or TypeScript to type check your entire application. 

If you donâ€™t use those, React has some built-in type checking abilities. To run type checking on the props for a component, you can assign the special ```propTypes``` property:

```
import React, { Component } from 'react';
import PropTypes from 'prop-types';

class Checkout extends Component {
  render() {
    return (
      <h1>Your cart has {this.props.quantity} items</h1>
    );
  }
}

Checkout.propTypes = {
  quantity: PropTypes.number
};

```

```PropTypes``` allows a range of validators that can be used to check if the data you receive is the correct type of data. In the above example, we are using ```PropTypes.number``` that checks if the incoming value is a ```integer```. When an invalid prop is passed down a warning will be shown in the console. ```PropTypes``` is only checked in development mode for performance reasons.
