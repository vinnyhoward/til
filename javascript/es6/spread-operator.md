# Spread Operator (Spread Syntax)

The spread syntax is just simply three dots ```...``` It provides a more concise way to allow an iterable to expand in places where there are more then zero or more arguments(function calls) or elements(for array literals), or even object expressions in places where there are zero or more key-value pairs.
