# What is the difference between lexical scoping and dynamic scoping?

```Lexical scoping``` refers to when the location of a function's definition determines which variables you have access to. On the other hand, ```dynamic scoping``` uses the location of the function's invocation to determine which ```variables``` are available.

Key Points: 

- Lexical scoping is also known as static scoping.

- Lexical scoping in JavaScript allows for the concept of closures.

- Most languages use lexical scoping because it tends to promote source code that is more easily understood.
