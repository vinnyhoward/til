# Call Stack

The JavaScript engine (which is found in a hosting environment like the browser), is a single-threaded interpreter comprising of a heap and a single call stack. The browser provides web APIs like the DOM, AJAX, and Timers.

This article is aimed at explaining what the call stack is and why it is needed. An understanding of the call stack will give clarity to how “function hierarchy and execution order” works in the JavaScript engine.

The call stack is primarily used for function invocation (call). Since the call stack is single, function(s) execution, is done, one at a time, from top to bottom. It means the call stack is synchronous.

## The Last In, First Out (LIFO)

At the most basic level, a call stack is a data structure that uses the Last In, First Out (LIFO) principle to temporarily store and manage function invocation (call).

Let’s break down our definition:

LIFO: When we say that the call stack, operates by the data structure principle of Last In, First Out, it means that the last function that gets pushed into the stack is the first to be pop out, when the function returns.

Let us take a look at a code sample to demonstrate LIFO by printing a stack trace error to the console.

## In Summary

The key takeaways from the call stack are:

1. It is single-threaded. Meaning it can only do one thing at a time.

2. Code execution is synchronous.

3. A function invocation creates a stack frame that occupies a temporary memory.

4. It works as a LIFO — Last In, First Out data structure.
