# Lamda Functions

Lamda functions are what are called `FaaS` or function as a service architecture. It is a computing service from AWS Amazon that lets you just worry about writing code and not have to worry about infrastructure. When the number of requests increases it auto scales for you and you don't have to do a thing.
