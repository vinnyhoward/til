## Introduction

This AWS Certified Developer - Associate (DVA-C01) examination is intended for individuals who perform a
developer role.
It validates an examinee’s ability to:

- Demonstrate proficiency in developing, deploying, and debugging cloud-based applications using AWS.

## Recommended AWS Knowledge

- 1 or more years of hands-on experience developing and maintaining an AWS based application
- In-depth knowledge of at least one high-level programming language
- Understanding of core AWS services, uses, and basic AWS architecture best practices
- Proficiency in developing, deploying, and debugging cloud-based applications using AWS
- Ability to use the AWS service APIs, AWS CLI, and SDKs to write applications
- Ability to identify key features of AWS services
- Understanding of the AWS shared responsibility model
- Understanding of application lifecycle management
- Ability to use a CI/CD pipeline to deploy applications on AWS
- Ability to use or interact with AWS services
- Ability to apply a basic understanding of cloud-native applications to write code
- Ability to write code using AWS security best practices (e.g., not using secret and access keys in the code,
instead using IAM roles)
- Ability to author, maintain, and debug code modules on AWS
- Proficiency writing code for serverless applications
- Understanding of the use of containers in the development process

## Exam Content

### Response Types

There are two types of questions on the examination:
- Multiple choice: Has one correct response and three incorrect responses (distractors).
- Multiple response: Has two or more correct responses out of five or more options.

Select one or more responses that best complete the statement or answer the question. Distractors, or incorrect
answers, are response options that an examinee with incomplete knowledge or skill would likely choose. However,
they are generally plausible responses that fit in the content area defined by the test objective.
Unanswered questions are scored as incorrect; there is no penalty for guessing. 

## Unscored Content

Your examination may include non-scored questions that are placed on the test to gather statistical information.
These questions are not identified on the form, and do not affect your score.

## Exam Results

The AWS Certified Developer - Associate (DVA-C01) examination is a pass or fail exam. The examination is scored
against a minimum standard established by AWS professionals guided by certification industry best practices and
guidelines.

Your results for the examination are reported as a score from 100–1,000, with a minimum passing score of 720. Your score shows how you performed on the examination as a whole and whether or not you passed. Scaled
scoring models are used to equate scores across multiple exam forms that may have slightly different difficulty levels.

Your score report contains a table of classifications of your performance at each section level. This information is designed to provide general feedback concerning your examination performance. The examination uses a compensatory scoring model, which means that you do not need to “pass” the individual sections, only the overall examination. Each section of the examination has a specific weighting, so some sections have more questions than others. The table contains general information, highlighting y
our strengths and weaknesses. Exercise caution when interpreting section-level feedback.
