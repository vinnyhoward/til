# AWS CDK

The AWS Cloud Development Kit (AWS CDK) is an open source software development framework to define your cloud application resources using familiar programming languages.

Provisioning cloud applications can be a challenging process that requires you to perform manual actions, write custom scripts, maintain templates, or learn domain-specific languages. AWS CDK uses the familiarity and expressive power of programming languages for modeling your applications. It provides you with high-level components called constructs that preconfigure cloud resources with proven defaults, so you can build cloud applications without needing to be an expert. AWS CDK provisions your resources in a safe, repeatable manner through AWS CloudFormation. It also enables you to compose and share your own custom constructs that incorporate your organization's requirements, helping you start new projects faster.

For customers who prefer Terraform, cdk tf provides the CDK constructs for defining Terraform HCL state files in TypeScript and Python. For kubernetes users, the cdk8s project enables you to use CDK constructs for defining kubernetes configuration in TypeScript, Python, and Java. cdk8s can be used to define kubernetes infrastructure running anywhere and can be used with the AWS CDKâ€™s Amazon Elastic Kubernetes Service (Amazon EKS) construct library. Both cdk8s and cdk tf are alpha releases.
