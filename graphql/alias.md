# Alias 

If you have a sharp eye, you may have noticed that, since the result object fields match the name of the field in the query but don't include arguments, you can't directly query for the same field with different arguments. That's why you need aliases - they let you rename the result of a field to anything you want.


Example Query:
```
{
  empireHero: hero(episode: EMPIRE) {
    name
  }
  jediHero: hero(episode: JEDI) {
    name
  }
}
```

Example Output:
```
{
  "data": {
    "empireHero": {
      "name": "Luke Skywalker"
    },
    "jediHero": {
      "name": "R2-D2"
    }
  }
}
```

In the above example, the two hero fields would have conflicted, but since we can alias them to different names, we can get both results in one request.
