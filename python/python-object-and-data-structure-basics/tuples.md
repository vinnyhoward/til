# Tuples

```Tuples``` are very similar to lists. However they have one key difference, which is ```immutability```

Once an element is inside a ```tuple```, it can not be reassigned.

```Tuples``` use parenthesis. ``` (1,2,3)```

Just like lists, they can store different types of data structures such as ```strings```, ```integers```, ```lists```, ```dictionaries```, other ```tuples```.
Examples of ```tuple``` use:

```
t = ('a', 'b', 'c', 'a')

t.count('a')
Output: 2

t.count('b')
Output: 1

t.index('a')
Output: 0

t.index('b')
Output: 1
```
