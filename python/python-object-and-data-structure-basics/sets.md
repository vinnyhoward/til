# Sets

```Sets``` are unordered collections of unique elements, meaning there can only be one representative of the same object. 
Examples would be:
```
myset = set()

myset.add(1)

myset
Output: {1}

myset.add(2)

myset
Output: {1, 2}
```
Duplicates cannot be added.

Ways to assign a set would be:

```
mylist = [1, 1, 1, 1, 5, 6, 7]

set(mylist)
Output: {1, 5, 6, 7}
```
