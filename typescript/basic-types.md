# Basic Types

## Introduction

For programs to be useful, we need to be able to work with some of the simplest units of data: numbers, strings, structures, boolean values, and the like. In TypeScript, it allows developers support of types. With a convenient enumeration type thrown in to help things along.

## Number

```
let decimal: number = 6;
let hex: number = 0xf00d;
let binary: number = 0b1010;
let octal: number = 0o744;
```

## String

```
let color: string;
color = 'teal'
```

You can use template strings and embed different values into it without errors being thrown. 

```
let fullName: string = `Bob Bobbington`;
let age: number = 37;
let sentence: string = `Hello, my name is ${ fullName }.

I'll be ${ age + 1 } years old next month.`;
```

## Boolean

```
let isBool: boolean = false
```

## Tuple

```
// Declare a tuple type
let x: [string, number];
// Initialize it
x = ["hello", 10]; // OK
// Initialize it incorrectly
x = [10, "hello"]; // Error
```

When accessing an element with a known index, the correct type is retrieved

```
console.log(x[0].substr(1)); // OK
console.log(x[1].substr(1)); // Error, 'number' does not have 'substr'
```

When accessing an element outside the known indices, a union type is used instead.

```
x[3] = "world"; // OK, 'string' can be assigned to 'string | number'

console.log(x[5].toString()); // OK, 'string' and 'number' both have 'toString'

x[6] = true; // Error, 'boolean' isn't 'string | number'
```

## Enum

A helpful addition to the standard set of data types from JavaScript is the enum. As in languages like C#, an enum is a way of giving more friendly names to sets of numeric values.

The ```enum``` keyword is used to declare an enumeration, a distinct type that consists of a set of named ```constants``` called the ```enumerator list```.

Usually it is best to define an ```enum``` directly within a namespace so that all classes in the namespace can access it with equal convenience. However, an enum can also be nested within a class or struct.

By default, the first enumerator has the value 0, and the value of each successive enumerator is increased by 1. For example, in the following enumeration, Sat is 0, Sun is 1, Mon is 2, and so forth.

```
enum Color {Red, Green, Blue}
let c: Color = Color.Green;
```

By default, enums begin numbering their members starting at 0. You can change this by manually setting the value of one of its members. For example, we can start the previous example at 1 instead of 0:

```
enum Color {Red = 1, Green, Blue}
let c: Color = Color.Green;
```

## Any

```
let notSure: any = 4;
notSure = "maybe a string instead";
notSure = false; // okay, definitely a boolean
```

```
let notSure: any = 4;
notSure.ifItExists(); // okay, ifItExists might exist at runtime
notSure.toFixed(); // okay, toFixed exists (but the compiler doesn't check)

let prettySure: Object = 4;
prettySure.toFixed(); // Error: Property 'toFixed' doesn't exist on type 'Object'.
```

```
let list: any[] = [1, true, "free"];

list[1] = 100;

```

## Void

void is a little like the opposite of any: the absence of having any type at all. You may commonly see this as the return type of functions that do not return a value:

```
function warnUser(): void {
    console.log("This is my warning message");
}
```

Declaring variables of type void is not useful because you can only assign undefined or null to them:

```
let unusable: void = undefined;
```

## Null and Undefined

In TypeScript, both ```undefined``` and ```null``` actually have their own types named ```undefined``` and ```null``` respectively. Much like ```void```, theyâ€™re not extremely useful on their own:

```
// Not much else we can assign to these variables!
let u: undefined = undefined;
let n: null = null;
```


## Never

```Never``` represents the type of values that never occur. For example, ```never``` is the return type for a function expression or an arrow function expression that always throws an exception or one that never returns; Variables also acquire the type never when narrowed by any type guards that can ```never``` be true.
