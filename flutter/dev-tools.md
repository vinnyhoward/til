# Flutter Dev Tools

## What is DevTools

DevTools is a suite of performance and debugging tools for Dart and Flutter. Itâ€™s currently in beta release, but is under active development.

## What can I do with DevTools

Here are some of the things you can do with DevTools:

-   Inspect the UI layout and state of a Flutter app. You can examine the widget tree and explore the elements/state within the widget and its children

-   Diagnose UI jank performance issues in a Flutter app.

-   CPU profiling for a Flutter or Dart app.

-   Network profiling for a Flutter app.

-   Source-level debugging of a Flutter or Dart app.

-   Debug memory issues in a Flutter or Dart command-line app.

-   View general log and diagnostics information about a running Flutter or Dart command-line app.

We expect you to use DevTools in conjunction with your existing IDE or command-line based development workflow.
