# Binary 

Binary is a base 2 number system invented by Gottfried Leibniz that is made up of only two numbers: 0 and 1. This number system is the basis for all binary code, which is used to write data such as the instructions that computer processors use, or the digital text you read every day.

## How does binary work?

The 0s and 1s in binary are used to represent OFF or ON respectively, that is, the turn off or turn on of an electrical signal or base2 exponent

## Why do computers use binary?

Binary is still the primary language for computers for the following reasons.

- It is a simple and elegant design.
- Binary's 0 and 1 method is quick to detect an electrical signal's off or on state.
- The positive and negative poles of magnetic media are quickly translated into binary.
- Binary is the most efficient way to control logic circuits.
